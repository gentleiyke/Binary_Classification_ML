### Customer Churn Analysis

#### Problem Overview

This project aims to analyse customer churn data to understand the factors contributing to customer retention and attrition. The analysis uses a dataset that includes various customer attributes and their subscription details. The primary steps involve data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

#### Steps Involved

1. **Data Loading and Initial Inspection**
    - Load the dataset and perform initial inspections to understand its structure and contents.

2. **Data Cleaning**
    - Handle missing values, especially focusing on the `totalcharges` column which has 11 missing values.
    - Convert data types as necessary to ensure consistency and accuracy in analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - Perform univariate and bivariate analysis to identify patterns and correlations.
    - Visualize data distributions and relationships using plots and charts.

4. **Feature Engineering**
    - Create new features from existing ones to enhance model performance.
    - Standardize numerical features to ensure they are on a comparable scale.

5. **Model Building**
    - Split the data into training and testing sets.
    - Build and train three machine learning models to predict customer churn.
    - Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and select the best model.

6. **Model Evaluation**
    - Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics (precision, recall, and F1-score).
    - Compare model performances and select the best-performing model for deployment.

7. **Model Interpretation and Insights**
    - Interpret the model results to derive actionable insights.
    - Identify the most significant features that influence customer churn.

#### Challenges

- **Handling Missing Values:**
    - The dataset contains 11 missing values in the `totalcharges` column. Properly identifying and handling these missing values was crucial for maintaining data integrity.
    
- **Feature Selection:**
    - Selecting the most relevant features for model training involved balancing between too many features (overfitting) and too few features (underfitting).

#### Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer churn, leveraging machine learning techniques to predict churn and offer insights into customer behavior. The findings can help businesses implement strategies to improve customer retention and reduce churn rates.
